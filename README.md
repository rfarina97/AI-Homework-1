Rook Jumping Maze

Simple BFS implementation to solve the rook jumping maze problem.

Usage: Input n m dimensions of the matrix, followed by coordinates of the starting position and the goal position. Then input the data of the matrix. 0 marks the end of input.

Input example: 
  5 5 0 0 1 3
  
  3 4 1 3 1
  
  3 3 3 0 2
  
  3 1 2 2 3
  
  4 2 3 3 3
  
  4 1 4 3 2
  
  5 5 0 0 4 4
  
  3 3 2 4 3
  
  2 2 2 1 1
  
  4 3 1 3 4
  
  2 3 1 1 3
  
  1 1 3 2 0
  
  0
  
Output: Number of steps taken for shortest path to goal on each subproblem. "No hay solucion" means that no solution to the goal could be found.
